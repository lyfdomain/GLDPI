# GLDPI
Accurate prediction of drug-protein interactions by maintaining the original topological relationships among embeddings 

# Main Files
This is a PyTorch implementation of GLDPI, and the code includes the following files:

* data_process.py
    - Generate the corresponding drug SMILES list and protein amino acid sequence list based on datasets (Biosnap et al.), and compute the drug similarity matrix based on the drug SMILES, as well as the protein similarity matrix based on the protein amino acid sequences.
*  model.py
    - Pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference
*  untils.py
    - Pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference
*  train.py
    - Pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference

# Main Requirements

* python==3.9 
* pytorch==1.11.0+cu11.3
* numpy==1.26.2
* sklearn== 1.3.2


# Dataset

* The BindingDB dataset can be acquired at https://github.com/peizhenbai/DrugBAN/main/datasets.
* The Biosnap dataset can be obtained at https://github.com/samsledje/ConPLex_dev/tree/main/dataset/BIOSNAP.
* The Davis dataset can be found at https://github.com/hkmztrk/DeepDTA/tree/master/data/davis.

# Ran the code

1.Extract esm_biosnap.zip to obtain the protein esm2 coding file  esm_biosnap.txt

2.Ran data_process.py to obtain drug similarity matrix DS.txt, protein similarity matrix PS.txt, drug SMILES list drug.txt, protein sequences list protein.txt and drug-protein interaction matrix dti.txt.

3.Run train.py to get the result.
