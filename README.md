# GLDPI

#Ran data_process to obtain drug similarity and protein similarity
#Run data_devide_davis.py (or data_devide_drugbank.py) to reproduce cross-validation data for each fold.
Run CombDPI_davis.py (or CombDPI_drugbank.py) to predict and evaluate our prediction results.
Run biosnap_data_process.py to generate correlation matrices (or extract the files we uploaded in the relevant folder).
Run CombDPI_biosnap.py to reproduce our predictions.
Noteworthy
The similarity matrices in the dataset/drugbank/similarity_matrices.zip package need to be extracted into the dataset/drugbank folder
